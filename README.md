# IntelliHome

IntelliHome is the effort of myself (Michael Loubier) and Gian Franco Vitola to build a solutions- and feature-based smart home shopping experience. The goal is to counter the existing difficulties within the Smart Home market space that are keeping it from expanding exponentially beyond its current bounds, namely the issue of consumer perceived value being lower than the actual potential value of the products and the issue of the difficulty in finding compatible products without needing to verify and search for compatibility information before making a purchase. 

Smart homes are smart. Shopping for them should be, too.
